description: Analyze the codebase and generate a report

1. List the files in the current directory to understand the project structure.
2. Read `package.json` to understand dependencies and scripts.
3. Check for common issues like excessive `console.log` usage or TODOs.
4. Generate a markdown report summarizing the findings, including project structure, key dependencies, and recommendations. Save it as `CODE_ANALYSIS_REPORT_<YYYY_MM_DD>.md`.
